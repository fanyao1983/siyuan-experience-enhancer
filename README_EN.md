Make SiYuan easy to use, beautiful, and genuinely smart: honed in real workflows, fully customizable themes and artful palettes, with AI woven into product details. Daily interactions and visuals are almost entirely rebuilt—toolbars, menus, titles, folding logic; search, navigation, focus mode; paste, tags, references; history restore, the AI assistant, and more.

Special thanks to Achuan-2 Tsundoku theme for 148 icons and the “Xiewei” theme for its sugar palette.

I promise the core features will always stay free for everyone.

- Adjustable global theme, typography, line height, radius, shadows, and more
- Built-in artful palettes and textures; one-click apply or tweak as templates
- Supports solid, gradient, and illustration-style backgrounds for both reading and presenting

## Intelligence

- Native ChatGPT/Gemini (and many other AI sites) in context: full/partial quotes and inline notes
- Automation: paste conform mode, auto-fetch link titles, localize web images
- Search & organize: auto-tagging, deep content understanding, aggregated headings/numbering, fast batch move or referencing

## FAQ

- Toggle features: each capability is independently controlled in plugin settings
